### What does the application do?
It allows users to store and categorize their spending. Users can add spending records to a list and refer to it later to check how much they spend every month. Spending record consists of "Title", "Amount Spent", and "Category of spending" (e.g. "Went to NoFrills" | 70 CAD | Groceries).

Additionally, users can sort records by all their attributes and create bar charts to visualize the expenses.
